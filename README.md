# Dukedom SBV
Dukedom is the classic game of medieval land management derived from earlier versions of the games Hammurabi and Kingdom.
This project tracks the effort to adapt the original program for use with the Microsoft Small Basic application.  The project is currently in test mode.
Rick Merrill and David Ahl are credited as the authors of the original game with later enhancements provided as contributions from Lee Schneider, Todd Voros, Vince Talbot, Jamie Hanrahan, David Barber and Richard Kaapke.
There are several code listings available in the public domain for the original game.  Additional information for a BASIC version of the game is available here: [Big Computer Games: Dukedom, Edited by David H. Ahl, published 1984]  (http://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/showpage.php?page=11).
